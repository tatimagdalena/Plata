Currency settings can be updated at any point.

```swift
//Currency symbol - default value: .fromCurrentLocale
plata.currencySymbol = .fromCurrentLocale
plata.currencySymbol = .code(codeString)
plata.currencySymbol = .symbol(symbolString)

//Decimal mark symbol - default value: "."
plata.decimalSeparator = ","

//Thousand mark separator - default value: ","
plata.groupingSeparator = "."
```

#### Properties

```swift
let cents: Int = plata.integer //100
let realValue: Double = plata.realValue //1.00
let formattedValue: String = plata.formattedString //$1.00
let numbers: String = plata.onlyNumbers //100
```


### ðŸ’° PlataField

A textfield to input currency values. It's mask is defined by it's Plata model customization.

#### Storyboard

On the textField Identity Inspector, set the class to PlataField and the module to Plata.

#### Properties

- `plata`
   - The currency value can be get at any time by the `plataField.plata` property
   - You can set an initial value setting `plataField.plata.integer` value

```swift
var plata = plataField.plataModel
plataField.plata.integer = 1000
```

- `valueLimitType`: the input text can be unlimited or limited by digits or value

```swift
// default: .digits(10)
plataField.valueLimitType = .digits(10) //PlataField input limited to 10 digits, including the decimal ones
plataField.valueLimitType = .cents(1000) //PlataField input limited to a $10.00 value
plataField.valueLimitType = .none //no limit, neither by digits nor value
```

- `associatedButton`: if an associated button is set, it will be disabled whenever the PlataField is empty or it's value is 0, and enabled otherwise.
